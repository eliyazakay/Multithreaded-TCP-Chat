# Multithreaded TCP Chat

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a multithreaded chat system implemented in Python using TCP sockets.
It supports communication between a server and multiple clients, allowing both **public (broadcast) messages** and **private messages** between users.

---

## ⚙️ Features

### 🔹 Server

* **Multithreading** – Handles multiple clients simultaneously.
* **Broadcast Messaging** – Sends messages to all connected clients except the sender.
* **Private Messaging** – Clients can send private messages using:

  ```bash
  /pm <username> <message>
  ```
* **Connection Management** – Keeps track of connected users, removes disconnected clients, and notifies others.
* **Graceful Shutdown** – Optionally, the server can notify all clients when shutting down.

### 🔹 Client

* **Username Login** – Prompts the user for a username when connecting.
* **Public Messaging** – Sends messages to all connected users.
* **Private Messaging** – Supports sending private messages with `/pm`.
* **Real-Time Communication** – Continuously listens for incoming messages.
* **Disconnect Command** – Type `quit` to disconnect from the server.
* **User Instructions** – Clear prompts for sending messages.
